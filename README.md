## Contributions

I received IMMENSE assistance from the Xpert Learning Assistant tool available through my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp account. This tool helped guide me through some difficulties, including error handling, conditional logic (mainly with Contact form functionality), evaluating code quality, and for loops to help code the Project and Portfolio compoments. In addition, I found this tutorial extremely helpful when learning more about the concept of nav and header lists. [React Navbar and Header Component | Tutorial-Hadyn Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwgdzwNYico). 

I also received assistance from my tutor for this project (name can be noted once permission is granted) to guide me through logic of implementing the Project component correctly within the Portfolio component, and from E Kathuria who helped me polish up the styling of the site.
